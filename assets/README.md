# Portfolio Project

## Victor Harris Portfolio

## This project consisted of me writing my code from scratch and stringing together some hobbled code. I cant give you an exact reason why the make up of my code looks the way it does. I just know that it kinda works. 

## I made it so that if you click on the links at the top of the page it takes you to the corresponding section. 

## I did not use any flexboxes from bootstrap, this is all vanilla css. 

## return
